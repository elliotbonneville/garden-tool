# Garden Workload & Weekly Schedules

## The Good News: Back to Eden Reduces Work

Your choice of BTE method significantly cuts maintenance:
- **60-80% less watering** (mulch retains moisture)
- **90% less weeding** (mulch suppresses weeds)
- **No tilling** ever

The main work becomes: harvesting, pest monitoring, and occasional planting.

## Seasonal Work Distribution

Garden work is NOT evenly distributed through the year:

| Season | Workload | Primary Tasks |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Early Spring** (Mar-Apr) | HEAVY | Bed prep, starting seeds, fence check |
| **Late Spring** (May) | HEAVY | Transplanting, direct seeding |
| **Early Summer** (Jun) | MODERATE | Weeding stragglers, watering, first harvests |
| **Peak Summer** (Jul-Aug) | MODERATE-HEAVY | Harvesting (daily), succession planting |
| **Fall** (Sep-Oct) | MODERATE | Fall planting, harvesting, cleanup |
| **Winter** (Nov-Feb) | MINIMAL | Planning, ordering seeds, rest |

---

## Three Effort Levels

### Level 1: MINIMUM (~3-4 hrs/week peak season)

**Who this is for:** You're exhausted, life is chaos, but you want something.

**What you can maintain:**
- 4-6 raised beds
- No succession planting
- Tomatoes, squash, peppers, one salad bed
- Drip irrigation on timer (essential at this level)

**Weekly Schedule:**

| Day | Task | Time |
|-----|------|------|
| **Monday** | Quick walk-through, harvest ripe items | 15 min |
| **Wednesday** | Harvest, check for pests, pull obvious weeds | 30 min |
| **Saturday** | Main harvest, any needed tasks | 45-60 min |
| **As needed** | Refill drip system, emergency fixes | 15-30 min |
| **TOTAL** | | **2-3 hours** |

**Trade-offs:**
- Less variety
- May miss some harvest windows
- Lower overall yield
- Still worth doing

---

### Level 2: SUSTAINABLE (~5-7 hrs/week peak season)

**Who this is for:** Your stated goal - ~1hr/day or less.

**What you can maintain:**
- 8-10 raised beds
- Some succession planting (beans, greens every 3 weeks)
- Full variety of crops
- Drip irrigation (strongly recommended)
- Perennials and berries

**Weekly Schedule:**

| Day | Task | Time |
|-----|------|------|
| **Monday** | Morning harvest, quick pest check | 30 min |
| **Tuesday** | Skip or quick walkthrough | 10 min |
| **Wednesday** | Harvest, light weeding | 30 min |
| **Thursday** | Skip or quick walkthrough | 10 min |
| **Friday** | Harvest for weekend, water check | 30 min |
| **Saturday** | Main work: planting, weeding, trellising | 60-90 min |
| **Sunday** | Harvest, planning, enjoy the garden | 45 min |
| **TOTAL** | | **5-7 hours** |

**Monthly Additions:**
- 2 hours: Succession planting session
- 1 hour: Pest/disease deep check
- 1-2 hours: Fertilizing/compost top-dress

---

### Level 3: IDEAL (~10-12 hrs/week peak season)

**Who this is for:** You've got the time and want maximum production.

**What you can maintain:**
- All 10+ beds at full production
- Aggressive succession planting
- Season extension (cold frames, row covers)
- Seed starting from scratch
- Detailed record-keeping
- Perennials fully managed

**Weekly Schedule:**

| Day | Task | Time |
|-----|------|------|
| **Daily** | Morning harvest + walkthrough | 20-30 min |
| **Monday** | Harvest, targeted weeding | 45 min |
| **Tuesday** | Pest patrol, trellising/staking | 45 min |
| **Wednesday** | Harvest, succession planting | 60 min |
| **Thursday** | Light day - harvest only | 30 min |
| **Friday** | Harvest, prep for weekend | 45 min |
| **Saturday** | Major tasks: new plantings, bed work, projects | 2-3 hours |
| **Sunday** | Harvest, planning, enjoyment | 1 hour |
| **TOTAL** | | **10-12 hours** |

**What you gain:**
- Maximum yield
- Extended harvest season
- Better pest/disease prevention
- More learning and optimization

## Task Breakdown by Type

### Daily Tasks (5-15 min)
- Harvest ripe produce (prevents over-ripening)
- Quick visual pest check
- Enjoy a tomato warm from the sun

### Weekly Tasks (30-60 min each)
- Deeper harvest session
- Weed patrol (minimal with BTE)
- Trellising/staking as needed
- Check irrigation

### Bi-Weekly Tasks (1-2 hours)
- Succession planting
- Side-dress with compost
- Pest treatment if needed

### Monthly Tasks (2-4 hours)
- Detailed pest/disease inspection
- Trellis repairs
- Path maintenance
- Planning next month's plantings

### Seasonal Tasks (half-day each)
- **Spring:** Bed prep, major planting
- **Early Summer:** Mulch refresh
- **Fall:** Cleanup, garlic planting, cover crops
- **Winter:** Fence inspection, tool maintenance, seed ordering

## Time-Saving Tips

### Invest in These (Save Hours Weekly)
| Investment | Time Saved | Cost |
|------------|------------|------|
| Drip irrigation + timer | 3-5 hrs/week | $150-300 |
| Thick wood chip mulch | 2-3 hrs/week | Free-$100 |
| Quality harvest basket | 30 min/week | $30 |
| Kneeling pad | Back pain | $20 |

### Efficiency Habits
1. **Harvest in the morning** - Cooler, produce is crispest
2. **Same path every time** - You'll notice problems faster
3. **Touch it once** - If you see a weed, pull it now
4. **Group tasks** - All staking at once, all harvesting at once
5. **Let some things go** - One missed zucchini won't end you

### What to Skip When Short on Time
1. Perfect weeding (mulch handles most of it)
2. Daily watering (drip system + mulch)
3. Fancy trellising (simple stakes work)
4. Record keeping (nice but not essential)
5. Seed starting (buy transplants instead)

## Realistic Expectations

### Year 1 Will Be More Work
- Building beds
- Learning the space
- Mistakes and corrections
- Everything is new

**Budget extra time:** Add 50% to estimates above for first year.

### It Gets Easier
- Year 2: You know what works
- Year 3: Perennials producing, systems dialed in
- Year 4+: Maintenance mode, BTE soil is amazing

### With Toddlers
Let's be real - your 1hr/day estimate may be optimistic with three toddlers. Consider:
- Cherry tomato picking = toddler entertainment
- Digging in dirt = free activity
- Short sessions beat long sessions
- It's okay to have an "off" year

## Sample Year 1 Schedule (Sustainable Level)

| Month | Hours/Week | Focus |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Jan | 1 | Order seeds, plan |
| Feb | 1 | Start seeds indoors (if doing) |
| Mar | 3-4 | Bed construction begins |
| Apr | 5-6 | Finish beds, plant cool crops |
| May | 6-7 | Transplant warm crops |
| Jun | 5-6 | Maintenance, first harvests |
| Jul | 6-7 | Peak harvest, succession plant |
| Aug | 6-7 | Peak harvest continues |
| Sep | 5-6 | Fall planting, harvest |
| Oct | 4-5 | Cleanup, garlic planting |
| Nov | 2-3 | Final cleanup, mulch beds |
| Dec | 1 | Rest, plan next year |

**Annual Total:** ~200-250 hours

That's about **4 hours/week averaged across the year**, with peaks in spring and summer.

## The Bottom Line

At your stated availability (~1hr/day):
- You can maintain 8-10 beds successfully
- Drip irrigation is non-negotiable
- Some weeks you'll do more, some less
- The garden will forgive a missed day or two
- Fresh tomatoes are worth it
