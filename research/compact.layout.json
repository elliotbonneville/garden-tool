    "overview": "## Back to Eden Garden for 2 Families (7 people)\n\nThis garden uses the **pure Back to Eden** method - quality compost/soil topped with deep wood chip mulch. This means significantly less watering, no tilling, and improving soil over time. The wood chip mulch suppresses weeds, retains moisture, and feeds the soil as it decomposes.\n\n### Philosophy\n- **Low water**: After establishment, the deep mulch means you may only need to water during extended dry spells\n- **No-till**: Never disturb the soil layers - just add more compost and mulch on top each year\n- **Feed the soil**: The decomposing wood chips feed soil biology continuously\n\n### What to Expect Year 1\nYear 1 is the hardest - you're building infrastructure and the soil ecosystem is establishing. Expect:\n- Initial labor for bed construction and filling\n- Learning curve with pest management\n- Some settling of soil/mulch layers\n\n### Years 2+\nThe garden gets **easier every year** as:\n- Soil biology establishes\n- Wood chips break down into rich compost\n- You learn your microclimates\n- Perennials mature and produce more",

After establishment (year 2+), you may only need supplemental water during droughts. Drip irrigation with timer handles most needs automatically."

    "tips": [
      "**Morning harvest**: Pick vegetables in the morning when sugar content is highest",
      "**Succession plant**: Don't plant all lettuce at once - stagger every 2-3 weeks",
      "**Mulch heavily**: 4-6 inches of wood chips. If you see bare soil, add more",
      "**Never till**: The soil ecosystem takes years to build. Adding amendments? Top-dress only",
      "**Pest patrol**: Walk the garden daily. Catch problems early. Hand-pick hornworms and beetles",
      "**Feed the soil, not the plants**: Add compost in spring, let soil biology do the rest",
      "**Keep paths clear**: Wood chip paths need refreshing yearly. They're also growing medium!",
      "**Rotate nightshades**: Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, potatoes share diseases. 3-year rotation minimum",
      "**Plant garlic in fall**: October/November planting = bigger bulbs next July",
      "**Don't rush spring**: Zone 6b last frost is mid-May. Patience prevents replanting",
      "**Take notes**: What worked? What didn't? Your garden journal is your best tool"
