# Raised Bed Materials - Cost Comparison

## The Problem with Cedar

Based on your sandbox experience:
- 5x5x24" cedar box = $1,000
- That's ~$50/linear foot at 24" height

For 10 garden beds (4x8x18" each):
- 240 linear feet of wall
- **Estimated cedar cost: $9,000 - $12,000+**

This is not cost-efficient. Let's look at alternatives.

---

## Option 1: Pre-Made Galvanized Metal Beds (RECOMMENDED)

**Why this wins:**
- 20-30 year lifespan (longer than cedar)
- No rot, no termites, no maintenance
- Easy assembly (1-2 hours per bed)
- Looks clean and modern
- Gets cheaper at scale

### Pricing (4x8 size)

| Height | Price Range | Example Products |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| 12" | $55 - $120 | FOYUEE, Land Guard, Pure Garden |
| 17" | $100 - $180 | Vegega, TRAMULL |
| 24" | $140 - $250 | Vegega 32" tall, Sunnydaze |

### Your Cost (10-14 beds)

| Height | Per Bed | 10 Beds | 14 Beds | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| 12" | ~$70-80 | $700-800 | $980-1,120 | Too shallow for hugelkultur |
| 17" | ~$120-180 | $1,200-1,800 | $1,680-2,520 | **RECOMMENDED** with pit excavation |
| 32" | ~$200-280 | $2,000-2,800 | $2,800-3,920 | Alternative if no pit |

## CRITICAL: Hugelkultur with Large Logs

**Problem:** Your logs are ~18" in diameter. A 17" bed can't accommodate them.

**Solution:** Dig pits underneath the beds (traditional hugelkultur method).

### Why Pit Excavation is Better

| Factor | 32" Tall Bed | 17" Bed + 18" Pit |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Bed cost (14 beds) | ~$2,800-3,900 | ~$1,680-2,520 |
| Logs insulated by earth | No | Yes (better moisture retention) |
| Soil depth above logs | ~14" | ~17" |
| True hugelkultur design | Partial | Yes |
| Extra labor | None | Excavation (~$300-600) |
| **Net cost** | Higher | **$500-1,000 cheaper** |

### How It Works

1. **Mark bed locations** (4x8 ft rectangles)
2. **Excavate 18" deep pits** at each location
3. **Place logs in pits** (they're now below grade)
4. **Set 17" metal bed on top** (edges sit on undisturbed soil)
5. **Lay hardware cloth** across bottom inside bed
6. **Fill with soil mix** on top of logs

### Excavation Details

- **Volume per pit:** 4x8x1.5ft = 48 cubic feet = 1.8 cubic yards
- **Total for 14 pits:** ~25 cubic yards of soil removal
- **Equipment:** Mini excavator (few hours work in clay)
- **Disposal:** Haul off or mound elsewhere on property
- **Estimated labor cost:** $300-600 (added to contractor quote)

### Benefits of Below-Grade Logs

- **Moisture reservoir:** Surrounding earth keeps logs damp longer
- **Temperature stability:** Earth insulates against freeze/thaw
- **Better decomposition:** Contact with native soil microbes
- **More growing depth:** Full 17" of soil above logs vs 14" with tall beds

**This is the traditional hugelkultur method** - logs are meant to be buried, not sitting in a container.

## Option 2: DIY Corrugated Metal + Wood Frame

Build your own using corrugated roofing panels + minimal wood framing.

### Cost per 4x8x18" bed
| Material | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Corrugated metal panels | $30-50 |
| 2x4 or 2x6 frame (pine) | $20-30 |
| Hardware | $10-15 |
| **Total per bed** | **$60-95** |
| **10 beds** | **$600-950** |

### Pros
- Cheapest option
- Customizable sizes
- Same durability as pre-made metal

### Cons
- More labor (building from scratch)
- Need some carpentry skill
- Contractor time = more $$$

---

## Option 3: Concrete/Cinder Blocks

### Cost
- Blocks: $2-3 each
- 4x8x16" bed needs ~50 blocks = $100-150 per bed
- **10 beds: $1,000-1,500**

### The Catch
- **Loses 40% of interior growing space** (thick walls)
- Your 4x8 exterior = only ~18 sq ft interior vs 32 sq ft with thin-wall beds
- Potential heavy metal leaching (fly ash in some blocks)
- MUCH more labor to stack and level
- Can't install hardware cloth underneath easily

**Verdict:** Not recommended for your situation.

---

## Option 4: Stock Tanks (Galvanized)

Farm supply stores sell galvanized stock tanks that work as raised beds.

| Size | Approx Price |
|------|--------------|
| 2x2x2 ft | $80-100 |
| 2x4x2 ft | $120-150 |
| 2x6x2 ft | $180-220 |
| 3x8x2 ft | $300-400 |

### Pros
- Ready to use, no assembly
- Deep (2ft standard)
- Very durable

### Cons
- Odd sizes (not exactly 4x8)
- Need to drill drainage holes
- More expensive per square foot
- Limited availability

---

## Option 5: Cheaper Wood (Pine/Fir)

If you still want wood, use construction-grade lumber instead of cedar.

### Cost per 4x8x18" bed
| Material | Cost |
|----------|------|
| 2x12 pine (2 @ 8ft, 2 @ 4ft) | $40-60 |
| Corner posts or brackets | $15-20 |
| Hardware | $10 |
| **Total per bed** | **$65-90** |
| **10 beds** | **$650-900** |

### Cons
- Rots in 5-8 years
- Will need rebuilding
- Not a good long-term value

---

## Recommendation

### Best Value: 17" Metal Beds + Pit Excavation for Hugelkultur

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| 14 beds @ $150 each (Vegega/Vego) | $1,680-2,100 |
| Shipping (often free) | $0 |
| Pit excavation labor (mini excavator) | $300-600 |
| Assembly labor (1-2 hrs/bed) | Included in project labor |
| **TOTAL** | **$1,980-2,700** |

**Compare to cedar: $9,000-12,000**
**Compare to 32" metal beds: $2,800-3,900**

**You save: $7,000-9,000 vs cedar, $500-1,200 vs tall beds**

### This Changes Your Total Budget

| Original Estimate | With Metal Beds + Pits |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Materials: $4,000-6,000 | Materials: $2,500-4,000 |
| Labor: $4,000-6,000 | Labor: $3,800-6,100 (adds excavation) |
| **Total: $8,000-12,000** | **Total: $6,300-10,100** |

### Why This Approach Works Best

1. **True hugelkultur:** Logs buried in earth, not sitting in a container
2. **Cost effective:** Cheaper than 32" beds even with excavation
3. **Better performance:** Earth-insulated logs retain moisture longer
4. **Full soil depth:** 17" of growing medium above logs

---

## Hardware Cloth Note

Metal beds work fine with hardware cloth:
- Lay cloth flat on ground
- Set bed on top
- Fold cloth up against inside walls
- Secure with clips or screws

No need to bury 24" deep since the metal sides go to ground level - rodents can't chew through metal.
