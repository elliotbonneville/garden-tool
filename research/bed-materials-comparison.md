# Raised Bed Materials - Cost Comparison

## The Problem with Cedar

Based on your sandbox experience:
- 5x5x24" cedar box = $1,000
- That's ~$50/linear foot at 24" height

For 10 garden beds (4x8x18" each):
- 240 linear feet of wall
- **Estimated cedar cost: $9,000 - $12,000+**

This is not cost-efficient. Let's look at alternatives.

---

## Option 1: Pre-Made Galvanized Metal Beds (RECOMMENDED)

**Why this wins:**
- 20-30 year lifespan (longer than cedar)
- No rot, no termites, no maintenance
- Easy assembly (1-2 hours per bed)
- Looks clean and modern
- Gets cheaper at scale

### Pricing (4x8 size)

| Height | Price Range | Example Products |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| 12" | $55 - $120 | FOYUEE, Land Guard, Pure Garden |
| 17" | $100 - $180 | Vegega, TRAMULL |
| 24" | $140 - $250 | Vegega 32" tall, Sunnydaze |

### Your Cost (10-14 beds)

| Height | Per Bed | 10 Beds | 14 Beds | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| 12" | ~$70-80 | $700-800 | $980-1,120 | Adequate for most crops |
| 17" | ~$120-180 | $1,200-1,800 | $1,680-2,520 | **RECOMMENDED** - good depth for BTE |
| 32" | ~$200-280 | $2,000-2,800 | $2,800-3,920 | Extra depth (less bending) |

### Recommended Products (17" Height)

### Budget Options (12")

| Brand | Product | Price | Link |
|-------|---------|-------|------|
| Land Guard | 8x4x1ft (2-pack) | ~$70-90 each | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Land-Guard-Galvanized-Bed%EF%BC%8C8%C3%974%C3%971-Vegetables/dp/B096THJ8B6) |
| FOYUEE | 8x4x1ft | ~$60-80 | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Galvanized-Raised-Vegetables-Planter-8x4x1ft/dp/B07T499RHJ) |

### Pros
- Cheapest long-term option
- Zero maintenance
- Pest resistant (no termites)
- Easy to move if needed
- Contractors just assemble, no carpentry

### Cons
- Can heat up in summer (mulch helps)
- Less "rustic" look (if you care)
- Fixed sizes (less customizable)

---

## Option 2: DIY Corrugated Metal + Wood Frame

Build your own using corrugated roofing panels + minimal wood framing.

### Cost per 4x8x18" bed
| Material | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Corrugated metal panels | $30-50 |
| 2x4 or 2x6 frame (pine) | $20-30 |
| Hardware | $10-15 |
| **Total per bed** | **$60-95** |
| **10 beds** | **$600-950** |

### Pros
- Cheapest option
- Customizable sizes
- Same durability as pre-made metal

### Cons
- More labor (building from scratch)
- Need some carpentry skill
- Contractor time = more $$$

---

## Option 3: Concrete/Cinder Blocks

### Cost
- Blocks: $2-3 each
- 4x8x16" bed needs ~50 blocks = $100-150 per bed
- **10 beds: $1,000-1,500**

### The Catch
- **Loses 40% of interior growing space** (thick walls)
- Your 4x8 exterior = only ~18 sq ft interior vs 32 sq ft with thin-wall beds
- Potential heavy metal leaching (fly ash in some blocks)
- MUCH more labor to stack and level
- Can't install hardware cloth underneath easily

**Verdict:** Not recommended for your situation.

---

## Option 4: Stock Tanks (Galvanized)

Farm supply stores sell galvanized stock tanks that work as raised beds.

| Size | Approx Price |
|------|--------------|
| 2x2x2 ft | $80-100 |
| 2x4x2 ft | $120-150 |
| 2x6x2 ft | $180-220 |
| 3x8x2 ft | $300-400 |

### Pros
- Ready to use, no assembly
- Deep (2ft standard)
- Very durable

### Cons
- Odd sizes (not exactly 4x8)
- Need to drill drainage holes
- More expensive per square foot
- Limited availability

---

## Option 5: Cheaper Wood (Pine/Fir)

If you still want wood, use construction-grade lumber instead of cedar.

### Cost per 4x8x18" bed
| Material | Cost |
|----------|------|
| 2x12 pine (2 @ 8ft, 2 @ 4ft) | $40-60 |
| Corner posts or brackets | $15-20 |
| Hardware | $10 |
| **Total per bed** | **$65-90** |
| **10 beds** | **$650-900** |

### Cons
- Rots in 5-8 years
- Will need rebuilding
- Not a good long-term value

## Recommendation

### Best Value: 17" Metal Beds for Pure Back to Eden

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| 14 beds @ $150 each (Vegega/Vego) | $1,680-2,100 |
| Shipping (often free) | $0 |
| Assembly labor (1-2 hrs/bed) | Included in project labor |
| **TOTAL** | **$1,680-2,100** |

**Compare to cedar: $9,000-12,000**

**You save: $7,000-10,000 vs cedar**

### This Changes Your Total Budget

| Original Estimate | With Metal Beds |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Materials: $4,000-6,000 | Materials: $2,500-4,000 |
| Labor: $4,000-6,000 | Labor: $3,000-5,000 |
| **Total: $8,000-12,000** | **Total: $5,500-9,000** |

### Why This Approach Works Best

1. **Simple:** No excavation, just fill and mulch
2. **Cost effective:** Far cheaper than cedar or custom builds
3. **Low maintenance:** Metal lasts 20-30 years, BTE method reduces watering
4. **Good depth:** 17" is plenty for most vegetables with quality soil

## Hardware Cloth Note

Metal beds work fine with hardware cloth:
- Lay cloth flat at bottom of bed
- Fold edges up against inside walls a few inches
- Secure with clips or screws

Metal sides block rodents from chewing through - hardware cloth on bottom prevents burrowing up from below.
