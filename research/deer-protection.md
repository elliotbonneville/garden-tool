# Deer Protection Strategy

## The Bottom Line
**8-foot tall fencing is the gold standard.** Deer can jump 7-8 feet, so anything shorter is risky.

## Our Design: Wood Frame with Black Mesh

### Design Overview
A sturdy wood post frame with black poly deer mesh stretched between posts. This combines the durability of wood framing with the effectiveness and near-invisibility of black mesh.

### Construction Details

#### Wood Frame
- **Posts:** 4x4 pressure-treated wood posts, 10ft long (2ft buried, 8ft above ground)
- **Spacing:** Every 8-10 feet for stability
- **Top rail:** 2x4 horizontal rail connecting post tops
- **Corner bracing:** H-brace or diagonal supports at corners for tension
- **Color:** Natural wood or stained dark (dark green/brown blends with surroundings)

#### Black Mesh Infill
- **Material:** Black poly deer mesh (2" openings or smaller)
- **Why black:** Nearly invisible from distance, doesn't obstruct views
- **Attachment:** Stapled to inside of wood frame with galvanized staples
- **Tensioning:** Pull taut between posts, use turnbuckles at corners

#### Gate/Door
- **Width:** 4ft minimum (8ft recommended for wheelbarrow/equipment access)
- **Construction:** Wood frame matching fence posts with mesh infill
- **Hardware:** Heavy-duty hinges, self-closing spring, latch with easy inside release
- **Location:** South side for easy access from house/shed

### Your Perimeter Math
- 40x40 garden = **160 linear feet**
- Posts every 8ft = **~20 posts** (plus 2 gate posts)
- Need one 4ft gate (or double 8ft gate)

### Estimated Costs (DIY)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| 4x4x10 PT posts (22 @ ~$15) | $330 |
| 2x4 top rails (175 linear ft) | $150 |
| Black poly mesh (175 ft @ ~$2-3/ft) | $350 - $525 |
| Gate hardware kit | $75 - $125 |
| Gate lumber | $60 - $100 |
| Concrete for posts (22 bags) | $110 |
| Staples, screws, fasteners | $50 - $75 |
| **TOTAL** | **$1,125 - $1,415** |

### Budget Recommendation
Plan for **~$1,200-1,500** to do it right with quality materials.

## Installation Tips

1. **Mesh opening size:** 2" or smaller (prevents deer entanglement)
2. **Bottom reinforcement:** Add metal mesh on bottom 2ft to prevent rodent damage
3. **Burial:** Bury bottom 6" or use ground stakes to prevent deer nosing under
4. **Post spacing:** 15-20 feet for poly mesh
5. **Corner bracing:** Critical for tension - use H-braces or angled supports

## Alternative/Cheaper Options (Less Reliable)

### Double Fence (works at 4-5ft height)
- Two parallel fences 4ft apart
- Deer won't jump into narrow space
- More materials but shorter height
- Good if you have local height restrictions

### Slanted Fence
- 6ft tall at 45-degree angle
- Deer perceive it as too wide to jump
- Uses less height

### Electric Fence (supplemental)
- Single strand at 30" height with peanut butter bait
- Trains deer to avoid area
- NOT standalone - use with physical barrier
- Cost: ~$200-400

## What NOT to Rely On

| Deterrent | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| Deer spray repellents | Must reapply constantly, deer adapt |
| Motion sprinklers | Deer learn to ignore |
| Soap/human hair | Minimal effect |
| 6ft fence alone | Deer will jump it |
| Plants "deer don't like" | Hungry deer eat everything |

---

## Recommendation

**Go with 8ft poly mesh from the start.**

The cost difference between doing it right vs. doing it cheap and watching deer destroy your garden is not worth the risk. You mentioned efficiency with budget - spending $1,200 once beats spending $400 three times and losing crops.
