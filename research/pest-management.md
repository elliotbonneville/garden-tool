## Back to Eden Philosophy on Insects

The Back to Eden method emphasizes **prevention through plant health** rather than reactive treatment. Paul Gautschi's core principle:

> "If you have a healthy vigorous plant, insects should not be a problem."

Wood chip mulch builds soil biology over time, creating conditions that naturally suppress pest problems.

## How Wood Chips Help with Pest Control

### 1. Beneficial Predator Habitat

Wood chip mulch creates prime habitat for pest-eating insects:

| Beneficial Insect | What They Eat | Habitat Preference |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Ground beetles** | Slugs, cutworms, pest larvae | Hide under mulch during day, hunt at night |
| **Rove beetles** | Aphids, mites, small insects | Thrive in decomposing wood |
| **Predatory mites** | Spider mites, thrips | Fine mulch layers |
| **Centipedes** | Slugs, grubs, small pests | Moist mulch environment |
| **Spiders** | General pest control | Establish territories under mulch |

**Research shows:** Gardens with 2-3 inches of hardwood mulch can support up to **5x more predatory ground beetles** than bare soil.

### 2. Improved Plant Vigor

Healthy plants resist pests better:
- Consistent soil moisture reduces plant stress
- Improved soil biology feeds plants naturally
- Moderate soil temperatures prevent shock
- Strong root systems support overall health

### 3. Does NOT Attract Termites

A common concern: **wood chips do not bring termites to your property** that aren't already present. Termites prefer buried, moist wood in contact with structures - surface-applied arborist chips are not appealing to them.

If concerned, use naturally termite-resistant chips:
- Cedar
- Cypress heartwood
- Redwood

## The One Downside: Slugs

**Slugs are the main pest challenge with wood chip mulch.**

Slugs love the moist, shaded environment under wood chips. This is a real tradeoff with the Back to Eden method.

### Why This Happens
- Slugs need moisture to survive
- Wood chips retain moisture (a benefit for plants, but also for slugs)
- Decomposing organic matter attracts slugs - it's their natural role

### Mitigation Strategies

#### Cultural Controls (Most Effective)
| Strategy | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Morning watering only** | Garden dries by nightfall when slugs are active |
| **Drip irrigation** | Keeps foliage dry, targets water at roots |
| **Pull back mulch** | Remove chips 2-3" around susceptible seedlings |
| **Reduce hiding spots** | Keep boards, debris, dense ground cover away from beds |

#### Active Control Methods
| Method | Effectiveness | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Hand-picking** | High | Go out 2hrs after sunset with flashlight |
| **Beer traps** | Moderate | Yogurt containers buried to lip level |
| **Iron phosphate bait** | High | Safe for organic gardens (Sluggo, Slug Magic) |
| **Copper barriers** | High | 4-6" strips around bed edges |
| **Diatomaceous earth** | Low-Moderate | Reapply after rain |

#### Natural Predators
Encourage these slug predators:
- Ground beetles (provided by mulch!)
- Toads and frogs
- Birds (thrushes, blackbirds)
- Snakes
- Ducks/chickens (if applicable)

### The Tradeoff

Charles Dowding (famous no-dig gardener) switched from deep mulch to compost-only because of slug pressure in his UK climate. However:

- Rhode Island has drier summers than UK
- Ground beetles thrive in your wood chip system and eat slugs
- The moisture retention benefits may outweigh slug issues
- Monitor Year 1 and adjust if needed

## Organic Remedies for Infestations

If a pest problem does occur, Paul Gautschi recommends:

### Garlic-Cayenne Spray (Homemade)
```
- 2-3 bulbs garlic
- 2-3 hot cayenne peppers
- 1 quart water
Blend, strain, spray on affected plants
```
Safe for vegetables and fruits. Grow your own ingredients.

### Other Organic Options
| Product | Target Pests | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Neem oil | Aphids, mites, whiteflies | Disrupts feeding and reproduction |
| Diatomaceous earth | Soft-bodied insects | Physical barrier, reapply after rain |
| Insecticidal soap | Aphids, mites, soft insects | Direct contact only |
| Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) | Caterpillars | Specific to caterpillar pests |
| Spinosad | Beetles, caterpillars, thrips | Derived from soil bacteria |

---

## Year-by-Year Expectations

### Year 1
- Soil biology still developing
- May see more pest pressure initially
- Monitor closely, hand-pick as needed
- Beneficial insect populations building

### Year 2-3
- Soil ecosystem maturing
- Beneficial predator populations established
- Natural balance emerging
- Less intervention needed

### Year 4+
- Mature Back to Eden system
- Minimal pest problems for healthy plants
- Intervention rarely needed
- "Nature does the work"

## Specific Pest Notes for Zone 6b

### Common Exeter RI Pests to Watch

| Pest | Crops Affected | BTE Impact | Notes |
|------|----------------|------------|-------|
| Japanese beetles | Beans, berries, many plants | Neutral | Hand-pick, milky spore for grubs |
| Tomato hornworm | Tomatoes, peppers | Neutral | Hand-pick, Bt if severe |
| Squash vine borer | Squash, zucchini | Neutral | Wrap stems, row covers early |
| Colorado potato beetle | Potatoes, eggplant | Neutral | Hand-pick, rotate crops |
| Aphids | Many crops | Reduced | Beneficial insects help control |
| Slugs | Lettuce, hostas, seedlings | **Increased** | See mitigation above |
| Cucumber beetles | Cucumbers, melons | Neutral | Row covers until flowering |

---

## Summary

**Back to Eden reduces most pest problems** by:
1. Creating habitat for beneficial predators
2. Building healthier, more pest-resistant plants
3. Supporting balanced soil ecosystems

**Main challenge:** Slug management - mitigate with morning watering, iron phosphate bait, and encouraging ground beetles.

**Bottom line:** The system works with nature rather than against it. Expect a 2-3 year transition period before the full benefits emerge.
