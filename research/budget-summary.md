# Garden Budget Summary

## UPDATED: Hired Labor + Pure Back to Eden Method

You're hiring contractors and using 17" metal beds filled with quality compost/soil mix, topped with deep wood chip mulch. Pure Back to Eden (no hugelkultur) - simpler to build, less labor, same low-maintenance benefits.

## One-Time Infrastructure Costs (WITH LABOR)

### Materials (UPDATED - Metal Beds + Pure BTE)

| Item | Low Est. | High Est. | Notes |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Deer Fence (8ft, 160 linear ft)** | $1,000 | $1,500 | Poly mesh, posts, gate, hardware |
| **Fence Baseboard (PT 2x6, 160 lin ft)** | $200 | $300 | Pressure-treated lumber for hardware cloth attachment |
| **Galvanized Metal Beds (14 x 4x8x17")** | $1,680 | $2,520 | [Vegega](https://www.vegega.com/) or [Vego Garden](https://www.vegogarden.com/), 20-30 yr lifespan |
| **Hardware Cloth (1/4" mesh, full floor)** | $1,800 | $2,700 | ~1,800 sq ft - wraps around baseboard & covers entire enclosure |
| **Bed Fill (bulk compost/soil)** | $500 | $1,000 | Mushroom compost + topsoil mix, delivered |
| **Wood Chips (mulch)** | $100 | $200 | 4-6" deep, or free from arborists |
| **Drip Irrigation** | $150 | $300 | Optional with BTE |
| **Bird Netting + Frame** | $150 | $300 | For berry area |
| **Peat Moss (pH buffer)** | $50 | $100 | Counteracts mushroom compost alkalinity |
| **Soil Testing (URI Extension)** | $20 | $40 | Test compost before buying + beds after |
| **MATERIALS SUBTOTAL** | **$5,650** | **$8,960** | |

**Note:** Cedar would have cost $9,000-12,000 for the beds alone. Metal saves $7,500+.

### Labor (Contractor Rates) - UPDATED

| Task | Hours Est. | Rate | Cost Range |
|------|------------|------|------------|
| **Site prep & layout** | 4-8 | $50-80/hr | $200 - $640 |
| **Deer fence installation** | 8-16 | $50-80/hr | $400 - $1,280 |
| **Baseboard install (PT 2x6)** | 4-6 | $50-80/hr | $200 - $480 |
| **Hardware cloth (full floor)** | 8-12 | $50-80/hr | $400 - $960 |
| **Metal bed assembly (14 beds)** | 14-21 | $50-80/hr | $700 - $1,680 |
| **Soil/compost filling** | 6-10 | $50-80/hr | $300 - $800 |
| **Wood chip mulching** | 2-4 | $50-80/hr | $100 - $320 |
| **Irrigation install (optional)** | 4-6 | $50-80/hr | $200 - $480 |
| **LABOR SUBTOTAL** | **50-83 hrs** | | **$2,500 - $6,640** |

**Note:** Metal beds = no carpentry, just assembly. Full floor hardware cloth takes more time than per-bed, but provides complete rodent exclusion.

### Total Project Cost (Hired Out) - REVISED

| Scenario | Materials | Labor | **TOTAL** |
|----------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Budget** | $5,650 | $2,500 | **$8,150** |
| **Mid-Range** | $7,300 | $4,500 | **$11,800** |
| **Premium** | $8,960 | $6,640 | **$15,600** |

**Realistic expectation: $8,000 - $12,000 all-in**

(Full floor hardware cloth adds ~$1,500-2,200 vs per-bed approach, but provides complete rodent exclusion for the entire garden.)

| Mid-range | $4,000 | $1,300 | 3 years |
| Premium | $5,200 | $1,500 | 3.5 years |

**After payback, you're "making" $1,000-2,000/year in produce value.**

## Cost-Saving Strategies

### Free/Cheap Materials
- **Wood chips:** ChipDrop.com or local arborists (free delivery) - key for BTE method
- **Leaves:** Neighbors bag them for you in fall
- **Cardboard:** Free weed barrier from stores
- **Compost:** Start a pile now for next year

### Smart Purchases
- **Buy seeds, not starts:** $3 seed packet vs $5/plant
- **Bulk compost:** $40/cubic yard vs $8/bag
- **End-of-season sales:** Buy perennials in fall
- **Share with other family:** Split seed packets, bulk purchases

### Phased Spending
Build 4-6 beds this year, add more next year. Spreads cost and lets you learn what works.

## Recommendations

Given your goals (efficiency, feeding 7, breadth of variety):

1. **Don't skimp on deer fence** - One lost crop season pays for the fence
2. **Consider mid-range beds** - Pine is fine, just expect to rebuild in 5-8 years
3. **Invest in drip irrigation** - Your time constraint makes this essential
4. **Start with 6 beds** - Learn, then expand
5. **Get bulk compost delivered** - Way cheaper than bags

### Suggested Year 1 Budget: $2,800 - $3,500

This gets you:
- Full deer fence
- 6 raised beds with good soil
- Basic drip irrigation
- Seeds and some starts
- Room to expand next year
