# Exeter RI Climate & Growing Zone

## USDA Hardiness Zone
- **Zone 6b** (some areas transitioning to 7a with climate shift)
- Inland location = cooler nights, longer winters
- Excellent for cold-hardy crops

## Frost Dates

| Event | Date |
|-------|------|
| Last Spring Frost | **May 15** |
| First Fall Frost | **October 15** |
| Growing Season | **~150 days** |

**Note:** These are averages. Watch for late frosts - Zone 6b is notorious for them.

## Planting Windows

### Cool Season Crops (can handle frost)
- **Start indoors:** Late February - March
- **Direct sow outdoors:** Early April (4-6 weeks before last frost)
- Examples: lettuce, spinach, peas, radishes, kale, broccoli

### Warm Season Crops (frost-sensitive)
- **Start indoors:** Late March - early April
- **Transplant outdoors:** After May 15
- Examples: tomatoes, peppers, squash, beans, cucumbers

### Fall Planting
- **Start:** Mid-July to August
- Plant cool-season crops again for fall harvest before October 15

## Key Considerations for Back to Eden in Zone 6b

1. **Soil warms slower** under wood chip mulch - may need to pull back chips in spring for direct seeding
2. **Shorter season** than advertised BTE results (Paul Gautschi is in Sequim, WA - Zone 8b)
3. **Heavy mulch is GREAT** for moisture retention during hot summers
4. Start transplants rather than direct seeding when possible
