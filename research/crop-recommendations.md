## Tier 1: Plant These First (Low Effort, High Return)

### Salad Greens (succession plant every 2-3 weeks)
| Crop | Why | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| **Lettuce (leaf varieties)** | Cut-and-come-again, fast | Kids like it mild |
| **Swiss Chard** | One planting lasts all season | Rainbow chard is pretty |
| **Kale** | Super hardy, frost improves flavor | Lacinato/dinosaur kale is milder |
| **Spinach** | Fast, cool-season staple | Bolt-resistant varieties |
| **Arugula** | Spicy, self-seeds | Plant in spring & fall |

### Set-and-Forget Vegetables
| Crop | Why | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| **Zucchini/Summer Squash** | 2-3 plants feed a family | Pick small for best flavor |
| **Bush Beans** | No trellising, heavy producer | Plant every 2 weeks for continuous harvest |
| **Garlic** | Plant fall, harvest summer, zero work | Hardneck varieties for Zone 6b |
| **Potatoes** | Works great in BTE/mulch | Just keep mounding |
| **Onions** | Plant sets, minimal care | Storage varieties or fresh |

### Toddler Favorites
| Crop | Why | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| **Cherry Tomatoes** | Kids love picking, sweet | Sungold, Sweet 100 |
| **Snap Peas** | Sweet, eat off the vine | Need short trellis |
| **Carrots** | Fun to pull, sweet | Loose soil important |
| **Cucumbers** | Productive, kid-friendly | Bush varieties need no trellis |

## Tier 2: Great Additions (Moderate Effort)

| Crop | Effort Level | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Tomatoes (slicing)** | Medium | Need staking/caging |
| **Peppers (sweet)** | Low-medium | Slow to start but low maintenance once going |
| **Winter Squash** | Low | Takes space but stores well on counter |
| **Broccoli** | Medium | Cool season, watch for caterpillars |
| **Cabbage** | Low-medium | One harvest per plant |
| **Beets** | Low | Eat roots AND greens |
| **Radishes** | Very low | 30-45 days, good for kids |

---

## Tier 3: Consider If Space Allows

| Crop | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Herbs (basil, cilantro, parsley, dill)** | Essential for cooking |
| **Pole Beans** | Higher yield than bush but needs trellis |
| **Melons** | Space hogs but delicious |
| **Eggplant** | If you like it |
| **Leeks** | Long season but low maintenance |

---

## Perennials to Consider (One-Time Planting)

These go **outside** the main annual beds:

| Crop | Yield | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Asparagus** | 10-25 years production | Takes 2-3 years to establish |
| **Rhubarb** | Decades of production | Great for pies |
| **Strawberries** | Heavy producer | June-bearing or everbearing |
| **Raspberries** | 5-10 lbs per plant | Need their own area |
| **Blueberries** | Need acidic soil | May need amending |

## Back to Eden Specific Notes

### Works Well with BTE
- Tomatoes, squash, cucumbers (transplants)
- Potatoes (mulch makes hilling easy)
- Perennials
- Anything transplanted

### Challenging with BTE
- Direct-seeded small seeds (carrots, lettuce)
- **Solution:** Pull back mulch, seed into soil, thin mulch back over once established

### Avoid These Woods in Chips (Traditional Advice)
- Black walnut (juglone toxicity - see note below)
- Pine (acidic, slow to decompose)
- Eucalyptus (allelopathic compounds)
- Tree of Heaven (allelopathic)

**Note on Black Walnut:** Traditional extension advice says avoid it. However, recent research suggests juglone is mostly in roots/hulls, not wood. Composted walnut chips (6+ months) are likely safe. When in doubt, avoid for tomatoes, peppers, potatoes which are most sensitive.

## Caloric Density Considerations

Since you're feeding 7 people, prioritize some calorie-dense crops:

| Crop | Calories/lb | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Potatoes | 350 | Excellent staple |
| Winter Squash | 150-200 | Stores on counter for months |
| Beans (dry) | 1,500+ | If you want to dry some |
| Corn | 400 | Space-inefficient though |

For **fresh eating only**, focus on variety over calories - you're supplementing, not replacing grocery shopping.

## What to Skip

| Crop | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Corn** | Needs lots of space, one ear per stalk |
| **Pumpkins** | Unless you want them - space hogs |
| **Brussels Sprouts** | Long season, finicky |
| **Cauliflower** | Difficult, one head per plant |
| **Celery** | High maintenance |
