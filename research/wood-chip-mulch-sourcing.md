# Wood Chip Mulch Sourcing: Using Your Log Pile

## Overview

You have a large pile of rotting oak and maple logs in your backyard that have been decomposing for years. This is potentially an excellent (and free) source of mulch for your Back to Eden garden beds.

**Aged/decomposed wood is actually BETTER than fresh chips** because:
- Already past the nitrogen-hungry decomposition phase
- Colonized by beneficial fungi
- Breaks down faster into soil
- Less risk of nutrient tie-up

## Checklist: Before Chipping

### 1. Verify Wood Species (CRITICAL)

| Species | Safe? | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Oak | **YES** | Excellent choice, breaks down slowly |
| Maple | **YES** | Great for mulch |
| Black Walnut | **NO** | Contains juglone toxin - kills tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, potatoes |
| Butternut | **NO** | Also contains juglone |
| Hickory | **YES** | Safe to use |
| Pine/Spruce | **YES** | Safe, slightly acidic (fine for most plants) |

**Action item:** Have the arborist identify any questionable wood before chipping. Black walnut has distinctive dark heartwood and large compound leaves (if any remain). When in doubt, leave it out.

### 2. Assess Decomposition Level

| Condition | Usability | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Solid but aged | Best | Will chip cleanly, already past nitrogen-hungry phase |
| Punky/soft | Good | May not chip as cleanly, very low nitrogen demand |
| Crumbling to soil | Use as-is | This is basically compost already, spread directly |
| Moldy/slimy | Caution | May indicate anaerobic decomposition, let it dry/air out |

### 3. Check for Contaminants

- [ ] No pressure-treated wood mixed in (green tint, CCA stamps)
- [ ] No painted/stained wood
- [ ] No plywood or particle board
- [ ] No railroad ties or utility poles

## Getting It Chipped

### Option 1: Hire an Arborist (Recommended)

Call local tree services and ask for "on-site chipping" or "brush grinding" services.

**What to ask:**
- Do you do on-site chipping of existing material?
- What size material can your chipper handle? (log diameter)
- What's your hourly rate or flat fee?
- Can you identify wood species?

**Expected cost:** $200-500 depending on volume and access

**Local arborists to call:**
- Search "tree service Exeter RI" or "arborist Washington County RI"
- Get 2-3 quotes

### Option 2: Rent a Chipper (DIY)

Only if you have help - chipping is hard work.

- Home Depot/equipment rental: ~$200-400/day for a decent chipper
- Need a truck/trailer to transport
- Requires feeding logs manually

**Not recommended** if you're hiring labor for the garden anyway - just have professionals do it.

## How Much Mulch Do You Need?

For Back to Eden, apply **4-6 inches** of wood chips on beds.

| Bed Configuration | Sq Ft of Beds | Mulch Needed (6" deep) |
|-------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| 10 beds @ 4x8 ft | 320 sq ft | ~6 cubic yards |
| 12 beds @ 4x8 ft | 384 sq ft | ~7 cubic yards |
| 14 beds @ 4x8 ft | 448 sq ft | ~8 cubic yards |
| Paths (optional) | ~200 sq ft | ~4 cubic yards |

**Total estimated need:** 10-12 cubic yards

**Your log pile:** If it's "many yards" of logs, you likely have enough. A cubic yard of logs produces roughly 2-3 cubic yards of chips (more air space).

## Backup: Free Arborist Chips

If your pile isn't enough, or as a comparison:

### ChipDrop (getchipdrop.com)
- Free service matching gardeners with arborists
- Sign up, arborists deliver when working in your area
- **Pros:** Free, large volumes
- **Cons:** Unpredictable timing, unknown wood species mix, fresh chips (more nitrogen demand)

### Call Local Arborists Directly
- Many will deliver free chips to avoid dump fees
- Can sometimes request specific species
- Ask: "Do you have any chips you need to get rid of?"

---

## Application Notes

### Nitrogen Tie-Up

Wood chips decomposing on soil surface cause **minimal nitrogen tie-up** - the concern is overstated for surface mulch. Problems only occur when chips are:
- Mixed/tilled INTO soil
- Very fine (sawdust-sized particles)
- Fresh and applied very thick

Your aged chips should have zero issues. If you see yellowing plants in year 1, side-dress with blood meal or composted manure.

### Keep Mulch Away From Stems

Leave 2-3" gap around plant stems to prevent rot and pest habitat. "Volcano mulching" (piling mulch against trunks/stems) causes problems.

### Replenish Annually

BTE mulch breaks down over time. Plan to add 1-2" per year to maintain depth.

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Cost | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Chip your own logs | $200-500 | Arborist on-site chipping |
| ChipDrop | Free | Unpredictable timing, fresh chips |
| Bulk mulch delivery | $30-50/yard | 12 yards = $360-600 |
| Bagged mulch | $5-8/bag (2 cu ft) | 12 yards = $800+ (don't do this) |

**Recommendation:** Chip your logs. It's in the same cost range as bulk delivery, but you're using material you already own, it's pre-aged, and you know the species.

## Questions to Ask the Arborist

When they come to quote or do the job:

1. Can you identify the wood species in this pile?
2. Is there any black walnut in here? (Show them photos if needed)
3. What's the maximum log diameter your chipper can handle?
4. Can you chip the really rotted stuff, or should we separate that?
5. Can you blow/direct the chips into a pile in a specific location?
6. What's your rate - hourly or flat fee?

---

## Summary: Action Items

- [ ] Walk the log pile, look for any suspicious wood (dark heartwood = possible walnut)
- [ ] Get 2-3 quotes from local arborists for on-site chipping
- [ ] Verify no pressure-treated or painted wood in the pile
- [ ] Ask arborist to confirm species when they visit
- [ ] Decide on chip pile location (easy access for wheelbarrowing to beds)
- [ ] Schedule chipping after beds are installed (or stockpile chips under a tarp)
