## Planting Timeline (Zone 6b)

## Care Tips
1. **CONTAIN IT** - Use barriers, containers, or dedicated bed
2. **Plant root cuttings** - Set at 45-degree angle
3. **Remove side roots** - For larger main roots
4. **Dig deep** - Roots can grow 2+ feet down

## Common Issues

Avoid planting near: Most vegetables (spreads into their space)

## Expected Yield
- Several pounds of roots per plant
- Harvest portion, leave some for regrowth

## Special Considerations

- Buried barriers (18"+ deep)
- Growing in large containers
- Dedicated corner away from other beds
- Any root fragment left behind WILL regrow
