# Blueberries

## Overview
Blueberries are long-lived perennial shrubs that produce delicious fruit for decades. They require acidic soil but are otherwise low-maintenance once established.

## Varieties for Zone 6b
- **Bluecrop** - Reliable, cold-hardy mid-season
- **Duke** - Early season, large berries
- **Jersey** - Late season, sweet flavor
- Plant 2-3 varieties for cross-pollination

## Growing Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Sun | Full sun (6+ hours) |
| Soil pH | 4.5-5.5 (ACIDIC - critical!) |
| Spacing | 4-6 feet apart |
| Years to Full Production | 3-5 years |
| Water | 1-2 inches per week |

## Planting Timeline (Zone 6b)
- **Plant**: Early spring or fall

## Care Tips
