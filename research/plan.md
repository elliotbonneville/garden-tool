## Open Questions

### Space & Site
1. Roughly how much space can you dedicate?
2. How much direct sunlight does the area get daily?
3. What's the soil like? (rocky, clay, sandy, etc.)
4. Is there water access nearby?

### Practical Constraints
5. Gardening experience level? (novice / some / seasoned)
6. Hours per week available during peak season?
7. Budget constraints for initial setup?

### Food Preferences
8. Foods your families definitely want or won't eat?
9. Interest in preserving food (canning, freezing, root cellaring)?
10. Any allergies or dietary restrictions?

## Answers

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Space available | ~40x40 ft minimum (1,600 sq ft) |
| Sunlight hours | 8-9 hours minimum (excellent) |
| Soil type | Heavy clay - using raised beds |
| Water access | Hose faucet ~10ft from garden edge (excellent) |
| Experience level | Some experience |
| Weekly hours available | ~1hr/day or less during peak (LOW - major constraint) |
| Budget | Have money but efficiency matters - no waste |
| Must-have crops | Open to anything |
| Won't eat | Nothing excluded |
| Preservation interest | No - fresh eating only (no bandwidth) |
| Allergies/restrictions | None |

## Key Decisions Made

### Growing Method: Back to Eden Style
- Wood chip mulching for moisture retention and weed suppression
- Raised beds with hugelkultur base (logs underneath)
- Mushroom soil/compost on top
- This method is LOW MAINTENANCE once established - good fit for time constraints
- **Watering:** Dramatically reduced after Year 1 - some BTE gardeners water only a few times per YEAR

### Build Specifications
- **Bed material:** Pre-made galvanized metal beds (20-30 year lifespan) - see [bed-materials-comparison.md](bed-materials-comparison.md)
- **Bed height:** 17" (Vegega or Vego Garden recommended)
- **Hugelkultur approach:** Dig 18" pits under each bed for logs (traditional method)
- **Why pits:** Your logs are 18" diameter - too large for beds alone. Pits are cheaper than 32" beds and provide better moisture retention.
- **Rodent protection:** 1/4" hardware cloth inside beds on top of logs (metal sides block burrowing)
- **Labor:** Hiring contractors (not DIY)

### Special Requirements
- **One bed dedicated to flowers**
- **DEER PROTECTION IS CRITICAL** - 8ft poly mesh fence
- **BIRD PROTECTION** - Netting for berry areas

### Constraints Summary
- Time is the biggest constraint (~7hrs/week max)
- Fresh eating only = focus on succession planting for continuous harvest
- No preservation = don't overbuild for storage crops

### Timeline
- **Start date:** January 2025
- **Build:** February - April 2025
- **Plant:** May 2025 (after last frost ~May 15)
- This is ideal timing - not rushed at all

### CRITICAL: Soil pH Warning
- **Test mushroom compost pH BEFORE buying in bulk**
- Mushroom compost can be alkaline (pH 7.5-8.0+) due to chalk/lime content
- High pH takes YEARS to fix - prevention is essential
- Limit mushroom compost to 20-25% of soil mix
- Include peat moss (10%) as acidifying buffer
- Target final pH: 6.0-7.0 (test BEFORE planting)
- See [soil-ph-composition.md](soil-ph-composition.md) for full details

## Quick Summary

### Estimated Budget (Hired Labor): $6,300 - $10,100
- Materials: $2,500-4,000
  - Deer fence: $1,000-1,500
  - **Galvanized metal beds (14 @ $150):** $1,680-2,100 ([Vegega](https://www.vegega.com/) or [Vego Garden](https://www.vegogarden.com/))
  - Hardware cloth (rodent): $400-600 (inside beds, on top of logs)
  - Soil/compost: $400-800
  - Bird netting: $150-300
  - Irrigation (optional): $150-300
- Labor: $3,800-6,100
  - **Pit excavation (18" deep, 14 pits):** $300-600 (mini excavator)
  - Site prep, fence, bed assembly, hardware cloth install
  - (Less labor - no carpentry, just assembly)

### Expected Annual Return: $1,000-2,000 in produce value
**Payback period: 5-8 years** (longer due to hired labor, but you get your time back)

### Time Commitment (Sustainable Level)
- Peak season: 5-7 hrs/week
- Off-season: 1-2 hrs/week
- Annual total: ~200-250 hours

## Remaining Questions to Decide

### Must Answer Before Building
1. ~~**Where is water access?**~~ ✓ Hose faucet 10ft away - perfect for drip irrigation
2. ~~**Exact plot location?**~~ ✓ Flat, no obstacles
3. **When do you want to start?** This year or next spring?

### Nice to Decide
4. **Which berries?** Blueberries need acidic soil. Raspberries spread. Strawberries need replacing every 3-4 years.
5. **Phased or all at once?** Build 6 beds this year or all 10?
6. **Cedar or pine beds?** 10-15 year lifespan vs 5-8 years

### Future Enhancements (Not Urgent)
- Companion planting chart
- Detailed succession planting calendar
- Seed starting schedule
- Season extension options

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. ~~**Decide on water access**~~ ✓ Hose 10ft away
2. **Measure exact plot** - confirm 40x40 or adjust
3. **Get soil/compost pH tested BEFORE buying bulk** - URI Extension $15-20
4. **Order deer fence materials** - long lead item
5. **Source free logs/chips** - start collecting for hugelkultur
6. **Get bulk compost quote** - local landscape supply (ask for pH!)

## Resources

### Soil Testing
- **URI Cooperative Extension Soil Testing Lab**
- Website: https://web.uri.edu/coopext/soil-testing/
- Cost: ~$15-20 for basic test (pH, nutrients, organic matter)
- Turnaround: ~2 weeks
- **DO THIS before buying bulk soil/compost**
