# Soil pH Testing & Composition

## Why This Matters - The High pH Trap

**High pH (alkaline) soil is one of the hardest problems to fix.** It can take months to years of repeated treatments to correct. Getting it right from the START is critical.

You mentioned using mushroom compost - this is a specific concern because mushroom compost is often alkaline.

## Optimal pH for Vegetables

| pH Level | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Below 5.5 | Too acidic | Nutrient toxicity, stunted growth |
| 5.5 - 6.0 | Slightly acidic | OK for most crops |
| **6.0 - 7.0** | **OPTIMAL** | Best nutrient availability, ideal bacterial activity |
| 7.0 - 7.5 | Slightly alkaline | Acceptable, some nutrients less available |
| 7.5 - 8.0 | Alkaline | Iron, manganese, phosphorus become unavailable |
| Above 8.0 | Very alkaline | Most vegetables will struggle |

**Target: pH 6.5** - This is the sweet spot for the widest range of vegetables.

## WARNING: Mushroom Compost pH Issues

You're planning to use mushroom compost. Be aware:

### The Problem
- Mushroom compost contains **up to 30% chalk (calcium carbonate)**
- Lime and gypsum are used in production
- Typical pH: **6.6 - 8.0** (can vary widely by source)
- Also high in **salts** - can cause leaf burn

### What Can Go Wrong
- Fill beds with pure/heavy mushroom compost → pH 7.5+
- Nutrients become locked up (especially iron, manganese)
- Plants show yellowing, stunted growth
- Takes 1-3+ years to correct with sulfur treatments

### The Solution: Test and Mix

**DO NOT fill beds with pure mushroom compost.**

| Mix Ratio | Mushroom Compost | Other Materials | Result |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Aggressive | 25% | 75% topsoil/other compost | Safer, more neutral |
| Moderate | 33% | 67% topsoil/other compost | Acceptable |
| Risky | 50%+ | 50% or less | May be too alkaline |

### Before You Buy
1. **Ask the supplier for pH test results** of their mushroom compost
2. If they don't know, buy a small amount and test it yourself
3. Look for "aged" or "spent" mushroom compost (more neutral than fresh)

## Recommended Soil Mix for Raised Beds

### The "Mel's Mix" Approach (Modified for BTE)

| Layer | Material | Depth | pH Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| Bottom | Logs, branches | 4-6" | Neutral, will acidify as they decay |
| Middle | Leaves, straw | 2-3" | Slightly acidic |
| Growing layer | Blended mix (see below) | 8-10" | Target pH 6.5 |
| Top | Wood chip mulch | 3-4" | Slightly acidic over time |

### Growing Layer Mix (Target pH 6.0-6.8)

| Component | Percentage | pH | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|-----|---------|
| Quality topsoil | 40% | 6.0-7.0 | Base structure |
| Aged compost (NOT mushroom) | 30% | 6.5-7.0 | Nutrients, biology |
| Mushroom compost | 20% max | 6.6-8.0 | Nutrients (limit due to pH/salt) |
| Peat moss or coconut coir | 10% | 4.0-5.0 (peat) | Acidifying buffer, moisture retention |

**The peat moss is KEY** - it counteracts the alkalinity of mushroom compost.

### Alternative: Skip Mushroom Compost Entirely

If you can't verify the pH, consider:
- Aged leaf mold (slightly acidic, excellent)
- Well-rotted manure (near neutral)
- Quality garden compost (neutral)
- Worm castings (neutral, expensive but excellent)

## CRITICAL: Test BEFORE Filling Beds

### When to Test
1. **Test your bulk compost/soil BEFORE you buy large quantities**
2. Test again after mixing but BEFORE planting
3. Test annually each spring

### Testing Options

| Method | Cost | Accuracy | Turnaround |
|--------|------|----------|------------|
| DIY pH meter | $10-30 | Moderate | Instant |
| DIY test strips/kit | $10-20 | Low-moderate | Instant |
| **Cooperative Extension soil test** | $15-30 | **High** | 1-2 weeks |
| Private lab | $30-75 | High | 1-2 weeks |

**Recommendation:** Get a proper soil test from URI Cooperative Extension or a lab. The $15-30 is worth it to avoid years of problems.

### Rhode Island Soil Testing

**URI Cooperative Extension Soil Testing Lab**
- Website: https://web.uri.edu/coopext/soil-testing/
- Cost: ~$15-20 for basic test
- Tests: pH, nutrients, organic matter, recommendations
- Turnaround: ~2 weeks

**Do this BEFORE you buy bulk soil/compost.**

## If Your pH Is Already Too High

### How Long to Fix?

| Starting pH | Target pH | Time to Correct |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 7.5 | 6.5 | 3-6 months |
| 8.0 | 6.5 | 6-12 months |
| 8.5+ | 6.5 | 1-3+ years |

High pH is buffered by calcium carbonate - it actively resists change. This is why prevention is critical.

### Methods to Lower pH

| Method | Speed | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Elemental sulfur** | Slow (weeks-months) | Cheapest, safest. Bacteria convert to sulfuric acid. Apply in fall for spring effect. |
| **Aluminum sulfate** | Fast (days-weeks) | More expensive. Works immediately. Can cause aluminum toxicity if overused. |
| **Peat moss** | Slow | Gentle, adds organic matter. Best as preventive. |
| **Sulfur-coated fertilizer** | Moderate | Acidifying fertilizers (ammonium sulfate) |
| **Pine needles/oak leaves** | Very slow | Mild effect, good as mulch |
| **Vinegar** | Temporary | NOT recommended - kills soil biology, effect doesn't last |

### Application Rates for Elemental Sulfur

To lower pH by ~1 unit (e.g., 7.5 → 6.5):

| Soil Type | Sulfur Needed (per 100 sq ft) |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Sandy | 1 lb |
| Loam | 1.5-2 lbs |
| Clay | 2-2.5 lbs |

**Important:**
- Don't apply more than 2 lbs per 100 sq ft at once
- Wait 3 months between applications
- Retest before adding more
- Takes heat to activate - apply spring or fall

## pH Tolerance by Crop

If you end up with slightly alkaline soil, these crops are more tolerant:

### Alkaline-Tolerant (pH 7.0-8.0)
- Asparagus
- Beets
- Cabbage family (broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts)
- Carrots
- Celery
- Garlic
- Leeks
- Lettuce
- Onions
- Parsley
- Peas
- Spinach

### Need Neutral to Acidic (pH 6.0-7.0)
- Tomatoes
- Peppers
- Potatoes
- Beans
- Corn
- Cucumbers
- Squash

### Need Acidic (pH 5.0-6.0)
- **Blueberries** (pH 4.5-5.5 - very specific!)
- Potatoes (prefer slightly acidic)
- Strawberries (prefer 5.5-6.5)

**Note:** Your berry beds may need different soil than vegetable beds.

## Maintenance Schedule

### Annual
- **Early Spring:** Test pH before planting season
- **Fall:** Apply sulfur if pH adjustment needed (gives winter to react)

### Every 2-3 Years
- Full soil test (nutrients, organic matter, pH)
- Adjust amendments based on results

### Ongoing
- Add compost annually (maintains organic matter)
- Wood chip mulch will slowly acidify over time (good for balance)
- Monitor plant health for pH stress signs

## Signs of pH Problems

### High pH (Alkaline) Symptoms
- Yellowing leaves with green veins (iron chlorosis)
- Stunted growth despite good watering/fertilizing
- Poor fruit set
- Blossom end rot (calcium can't be absorbed)

### Low pH (Acidic) Symptoms
- Yellowing leaves (different pattern than alkaline)
- Brown leaf tips/edges
- Poor root development
- Aluminum/manganese toxicity

## Action Plan for Your Garden

### Before Buying Soil/Compost
1. Get mushroom compost pH from supplier (or test sample yourself)
2. If pH > 7.5, either reject it or plan to heavily dilute
3. Consider alternative composts if pH is unknown

### When Mixing Soil
1. Keep mushroom compost to 20-25% of mix
2. Include peat moss or coir (10%) as acidifying buffer
3. Mix thoroughly before filling beds
4. Test the mixed blend BEFORE filling all beds

### After Filling Beds
1. Test pH of each bed (or representative sample)
2. If pH > 7.0: Add elemental sulfur (1 lb per 100 sq ft)
3. Wait 4-6 weeks, retest
4. Adjust before major planting

### For Blueberries
- Create separate acidic zone
- Use 50% peat moss in mix
- Target pH 4.5-5.5 (very different from veggie beds!)
- May need sulfur even with peat
