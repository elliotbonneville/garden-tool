# Rodent Protection - Hardware Cloth

## The Plan: Full Floor Coverage

The rodent protection system has three components:

1. **Pressure-treated 2x6 baseboard** along entire fence perimeter
2. **1/4" hardware cloth** wraps around the baseboard bottom edge
3. **Hardware cloth extends under entire enclosure** (full floor coverage)

This approach provides complete exclusion - rodents cannot burrow under the fence or into any part of the garden.

### Why Full Floor vs. Individual Beds?

With **galvanized metal beds**, rodents can't chew through the sides. But they could still:
- Burrow up between beds in pathway areas
- Access areas where we don't want them (compost, perennial plantings)

Full floor coverage eliminates all entry points once and for all.

## Mesh Size

| Pest | Minimum Mesh Size | Recommended |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| Gophers | 1/2" | 1/2" |
| Moles | 1/2" | 1/2" |
| **Voles** | 1/4" | **1/4"** |
| Rats | 1/2" | 1/4" |

**Recommendation:** Use **1/4" hardware cloth** - stops everything including baby voles.

## Installation Method

### Fence Baseboard + Wrap System

1. **Install pressure-treated 2x6 baseboard** along bottom of fence perimeter
2. **Staple hardware cloth to inside of baseboard** near top edge
3. **Wrap cloth around bottom edge** of baseboard (under the 2x6)
4. **Extend cloth inward** across entire garden floor
5. **Overlap seams 6"** and secure with landscape staples
6. **Cover with 4-6" wood chips** for paths, soil for beds

### Why This Works
- Hardware cloth is protected by baseboard (no exposed edges)
- Wrap-around prevents rodents from pushing under
- No digging required - cloth sits on existing ground
- Full floor = no weak points anywhere

## Material Options

| Type | Lifespan | Cost | Notes |
|------|----------|------|-------|
| Galvanized steel | 5-10 years | $$ | Standard, will eventually rust |
| Galvanized before weld | 8-15 years | $$$ | Better rust protection |
| **Stainless steel** | 12-20+ years | $$$$ | Install once, forget forever |

**Recommendation:** Since you're hiring labor and want longevity, consider stainless steel. The material cost difference is minor compared to labor - do it once right.

## Quantity Needed (Full Floor Coverage)

For 40x40 ft garden:

- Floor area: 40 x 40 = **1,600 sq ft**
- Add 10% for overlaps: **~1,760 sq ft of mesh**
- Baseboard lumber: 160 linear ft of 2x6 pressure-treated

## Cost Estimate

### 1/4" Hardware Cloth Pricing
- Galvanized: ~$1.00-1.50/sq ft (buy rolls, not small pieces)
- Stainless: ~$3-5/sq ft

| Material | ~1,800 sq ft | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Galvanized | $1,800-2,700 | Good for 5-10 years |
| Stainless | $5,400-9,000 | 15+ years, overkill |

### Baseboard Lumber
- 160 linear ft of 2x6 pressure-treated: ~$200-300

**Recommendation:** Galvanized is fine. Full floor coverage is more material than per-bed, but provides complete protection for paths and all areas. By the time mesh degrades, ecosystem is established.

## Installation Tips

1. **Wear leather gloves** - cut edges are razor sharp
2. **Install baseboard first** - gives you something to staple to
3. **Overlap seams 6"** - no gaps for critters
4. **Use galvanized staples** on baseboard, landscape staples on ground
5. **Work from one corner** - roll out cloth in strips, overlap as you go
6. **Cut around bed locations** if pre-planned, or just lay under beds
