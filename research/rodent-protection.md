# Rodent Protection - Hardware Cloth

## UPDATE: Metal Beds Simplify This

With **galvanized metal beds**, rodent protection is much simpler:
- Metal sides go to ground level - rodents can't chew through
- Only need hardware cloth on the **bottom** (no buried sides)
- No 24" digging required
- Saves $600-1,500 in materials and significant labor

## The Plan
Lay hardware cloth flat under each bed before filling with soil.

## Mesh Size

| Pest | Minimum Mesh Size | Recommended |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| Gophers | 1/2" | 1/2" |
| Moles | 1/2" | 1/2" |
| **Voles** | 1/4" | **1/4"** |
| Rats | 1/2" | 1/4" |

**Recommendation:** Use **1/4" hardware cloth** - stops everything including baby voles.

## Depth Considerations

For raised beds, you have two options:

### Option A: Flat Bottom Installation (Simpler)
- Lay hardware cloth flat on the ground under the bed
- Extend 6" past bed edges, fold up against sides
- No digging required
- Works because beds are enclosed boxes

### Option B: Buried Perimeter + Bottom (Your Plan)
- Dig 24" down around perimeter
- Install mesh on bottom AND sides
- More labor but maximum protection
- Overkill for most situations but won't hurt

**Note:** 12" depth is usually sufficient for burial. 24" is extra insurance but adds significant labor cost.

## Material Options

| Type | Lifespan | Cost | Notes |
|------|----------|------|-------|
| Galvanized steel | 5-10 years | $$ | Standard, will eventually rust |
| Galvanized before weld | 8-15 years | $$$ | Better rust protection |
| **Stainless steel** | 12-20+ years | $$$$ | Install once, forget forever |

**Recommendation:** Since you're hiring labor and want longevity, consider stainless steel. The material cost difference is minor compared to labor - do it once right.

## Quantity Needed (Metal Beds = Bottom Only)

For 10 beds at 4x8 ft:

- Bed footprint: 4x8 = 32 sq ft
- Add overlap to fold up sides: ~40 sq ft per bed
- **10 beds: ~400 sq ft of mesh**

## Cost Estimate

### 1/4" Hardware Cloth Pricing
- Galvanized: ~$1.00-1.50/sq ft (buy rolls, not small pieces)
- Stainless: ~$3-5/sq ft

| Material | 400 sq ft | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Galvanized | $400-600 | Good for 5-10 years |
| Stainless | $1,200-2,000 | 15+ years, overkill |

**Recommendation:** Galvanized is fine. By the time it degrades, root systems are established and rodents are less of a threat.

## Installation Tips

1. **Wear leather gloves** - cut edges are razor sharp
2. **Overlap seams 4-6"** - no gaps for critters
3. **Secure with galvanized staples** to wood frames
4. **Fold up sides** 3-6" against bed walls
